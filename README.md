# Student Attendance Analysis Dashboard  
**An Interactive Attendance Analytics System using Python, Pandas, Seaborn & Gradio**



##  Overview

The **Student Attendance Analysis Dashboard** is a complete, interactive data analysis project designed to analyze, visualize, and interpret student attendance records stored in CSV files.  

The system allows users (teachers/admins/students) to **upload an attendance CSV file** and instantly receive:

- Detailed attendance statistics  
- Lists of chronic absentees and eligible students  
- Daily and monthly heatmaps  
- Graphical insights into attendance trends  

This project demonstrates **real-world data analysis workflow**, **clean coding practices**, and **interactive UI/UX design**, making it ideal for **academic submission, viva, and portfolio use**.
 

##  Project Objectives

- Convert raw attendance data into meaningful insights  
- Perform **student-wise, day-wise, and month-wise analysis**  
- Visualize attendance patterns using heatmaps and charts  
- Provide a **user-friendly interface** using Gradio  
- Help academic institutions identify attendance risks early
